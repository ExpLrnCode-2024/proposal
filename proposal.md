Project title
: _Incorporating student perspectives towards Generative AI into the redesign of programming courses in the School of Physics and Astronomy_.

## Project summary

The proposed project seeks to understand how the experience of
undergraduate students taking programming courses has changed, and is
changing, due to the sudden availability of \'Generative Artificial
Intelligence\' (GenAI) systems such as OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and
GitHub/Microsoft's CoPilot.

The School of Physics and Astronomy (SoPA) is exploring some possible
alterations to its suite of programming courses, which would reflect a
change in stance towards encouraging limited use of GenAI in a manner
that is purposeful, responsible and critical. The essential aim of this
project is to produce primary evidence from students\' perspectives to
inform planned course redevelopments motivated by similar aims, both
within the SoPA and more widely.

The main inquiry will take the form of a series of interviews with \~25
student participants, whose experiences span the periods before and
after the advent of GenAI. Additionally, we will take a global snapshot
of student attitudes towards GenAI and our programming courses using a
survey.

The insights will feed into the development of a set of guidelines and
recommendations aimed at Course Organisers. Anticipating a wider
relevance than the courses we are directly involved with, we will take
steps to disseminate the findings of our study among colleagues in the
SoPA, the broader University community, and further afield. The key
results will be submitted for publication in a Focused Collection of the
peer-reviewed journal Physical Review Physics Education Research.
Finally, this study will serve as a baseline and potentially a blueprint
for follow-up work as the technological landscape evolves.


## Project aims

In this project we aim to meet the following key objectives.

1\. To gain insight into the shifting perspectives of students towards
their development as programmers in the wake of recent advances in
GenAI-assisted coding tools.

2\. To understand elements of our programming courses that are
high-value in terms of positive learning experiences and outcomes.

3\. To identify areas where GenAI stands to benefit or threaten these
positive learning experiences and outcomes.

4\. To develop a set of guidelines and recommendations that will assist
Course Organisers in incorporating GenAI into programming courses.

5\. To provide a blueprint that can be used or adapted in future for the
purposes of monitoring and evaluation of further changes to the
programming curriculum, and to develop resources to assist individuals
carrying out such work.

The proposed project is standalone, but naturally forms an initial
exploratory and baseline-establishment phase of a broader campaign of
programme transformation within the School of Physics and Astronomy.


## Background

### Context

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) refers to a recent
technological innovation which has produced systems that are capable of
generating high-fidelity, contextual and multi-modal outputs in response
to complex natural language inputs. What makes the GenAI revolution
unprecedented is its enormous transformative potential in the hands of
ordinary citizens, combined with breakneck speed at which it has been
able to realise that potential on a global scale. OpenAI\'s ChatGPT was
the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100
million monthly active users within two months of its launch in November
2022. All indicators point to GenAI becoming increasingly prevalent in
future societies, where it is expected to become deeply integrated in
the knowledge economy.

A recent UNESCO report titled *Guidance for generative AI in education
and research* [@Fengchun2023] emphasised the unpreparedness of educational
institutions for overseeing validation, integration and regulation of
GenAI systems for educational purposes. This is underlined by the many
divergent responses among individual educators and educational
institutions [@Xiao2023].

Over the last year, each of the programming courses in the SoPA have had
different policies towards the use of GenAI, reflecting the different
instincts of the Course Organiser(s). Some courses have imposed a strict
ban on the use of GenAI to generate code submitted for assessment,
treating it as a form of plagiarism and punishable with a mark of zero.
Meanwhile other courses have taken a light-touch approach, allowing
GenAI while attempting to convey its inherent limitations to students.

Given the lack of empirical evidence to support any given policy, this
diversity is not necessarily a bad thing. However, there is consensus
among Course Organisers that programming courses must be urgently
updated, or at least the emphasis reconfigured, to give students a
clarity of purpose and a more consistent experience as they progress
through their studies.

### Research Gap

There is unfortunately a dearth of high-quality empirical evidence
available to guide educators towards incorporating GenAI into
programming courses. Recent contributions to the academic literature
have highlighted important considerations [@Becker2023], but
guidance aimed at educators is often generic -- \"*AI can produce
inaccurate content*\" -- or, more worryingly, produced on behalf of
\'EdTech\' companies with vested commercial interests [@Williamson2023a].

Even more scarce are studies that focus on the student perspective. In
this respect, the composition of current undergraduate students in the
School of Physics and Astronomy is uniquely diverse; there are students
who took the full set of programming courses without GenAI, others who
took introductory courses without GenAI but have used it during advanced
courses, and new students who are currently taking introductory courses
with GenAI and have never known any different. This opens up a one-time
opportunity to gather primary data from the perspectives of students for
whom the sudden appearance of GenAI directly impacted their ongoing
undergraduate experience, potentially affecting their attitudes,
learning practices, and future outlook and career ambitions.

### Theoretical Influences

A pragmatists\' perspective on the overarching purpose of higher
education is that it should equip the learner with a suite of
experiences, technical skills and knowledge, and ill-defined
\'higher-order\' cognitive abilities that can be drawn on to engage with
complex real-world issues and unseen challenges. We take it as axiomatic
that these \'abilities\' are emergent properties of slow, complex, and
frequently self-driven processes loosely labelled \'deep learning\'
[@McGregor2020]. Our main substantive interest is in understanding where
GenAI has the potential to enhance or disrupt deep learning processes,
and thereby identify practical measures we can take to meet an optimal
balance between deep learning and raw skill acquisition.

The themes we have singled out as likely indicators of deep learning are
grounded in cognitive psychology. We furthermore build on a body of
educational research concerned with project-based learning, owing to the
fact that the majority of the programming courses in SoPA revolve around
project work. In particular, empirical studies have identified features
associated with a sense of *ownership* of one\'s work that positively
correlate with hallmarks of deep learning - see @Hanauer2014
and references therein. Given the popular framing of GenAI systems not
as tools but as \'assistants\' and \'collaborators\', we aim to
establish whether this is reflected in students self-reported feelings
of ownership towards their coding projects.

### Wider relevance

Although our study is situated within the SoPA, the difficulties of
accommodating GenAI in existing courses with established forms of
teaching and assessment are felt across disciplines. Arguably the
programming courses offered by the SoPA are a good testing ground for a
more general enquiry, being highly attended by students majoring in
mathematics, chemistry, informatics, engineering and subjects further
afield. This reflects the fact that these have been and continue to be
high-value courses for a wide range of students whose interests, prior
skills and life goals may be very different, and underscores the
importance of a granular approach. Our enquiry is also based around
broad themes, to be introduced shortly, that characterise general
learning experiences, and are not specific to physics or to programming.
We therefore expect any findings from our proposed study to resonate far
more widely than one might otherwise expect.


## Methodology

### Data collection

The understudied nature of the topic demands a flexible and
student-oriented approach to information gathering. The main source of
primary data will therefore be a series of semi-structured interviews
with a sample of approximately 25 student participants from the full
range of year-groups. Interviews will be broadly guided towards an
exploration of several key themes, identified a priori, while being
responsive to new themes emerging from the student participants. A
non-exhaustive list of the themes we intend to explore includes
*ownership* (including agency, individuality, aesthetic, pride)*,
affective state* (enjoyment, boredom, frustration, epiphany)*,
higher-order thinking* (strategic thinking, connectivity)*, peer group*
(peer support & competition)*, and wider context* (motivations,
aspirations, future planning)*.*

The process of recruiting the first round of student interviewees will
originate with a short \~3 minute Jisc survey, sent to students\'
university email accounts, which will feature a tick-box to indicate that
a student is willing to participate in an interview in exchange for a
£20 gift voucher. From this initial pool of candidate interviewees we
will select approximately 5 students for the first round of interviews,
giving preference to those graduating this summer. The survey provides a
secondary opportunity for data collection on a larger scale, which we
will use to take a snapshot of student attitudes towards GenAI in
relation to our programming courses. This will help to contextualise our
conclusions from the interviews and establishes a baseline for future
longitudinal studies.

The second round of interviewees will be recruited during the first week
of the Autumn semester. The RA will stand alongside a temporary display
in the James Clerk Maxwell Building foyer, where most students enter and
exit. On this display or table there will be information about our
project and a QR code for interested students to sign up. On this
sign-up page there will be an option to respond to a prompt question,
which we hope will help to select a group of interviewees with diverse
perspectives.


### Analysis

Interviews will be transcribed and coded: portions of text containing
pertinent information will be \'tagged\' with one or more discrete codes
that correspond to ideas or themes contained therein, with a new code
created every time a new theme or idea is encountered. The analysis will
be guided by qualitative studies with a similar aim of understanding
student attitudes towards their development as learners [@Thiry2011 ; @Stanley2015].
The results of the analysis will be
presented, where possible, such as to shed light on the following
questions:

1\. How do students understand their position/purpose/identity as
programmers in light of GenAI?

2\. How do students view their past/present/future studies in light of
GenAI? In particular, which elements of SoPA\'s programming courses were
most valuable or formative?

3\. Are there marked differences in the experiences and perspectives of
students who took the same programming courses with and without use
and/or awareness of GenAI?

Raw survey data will be processed and represented by visualisations and
summary statistics.

### Epistemological standpoint

Interviews will be conducted, transcribed and analysed by a Research
Assistant (JMR) with recent, first-hand experience of relevant
programming courses as both a student (2014-18) and instructor
(2019-23). Their proximity to the student experience is central to the
justification of an interpretivist analysis, which aims to \'read
between the lines\' and tease out meaning from complex responses.

JMR is also supervising two undergraduate students\' summer projects
which share the theme of generative AI in university teaching. Although
these students will focus on their own independent scholarship-funded
projects, they have expressed a keen interest in the project proposed
here. We are therefore considering the possibility that these students
could have some modest involvement, potentially as beta-testers for the
interviews and providing \'quality control\' on the post-interview
analysis.

### Data Privacy and Ethics

The survey will not request information on ethnicity since such
information can be used to identify individuals within such a small
population. We will instead ask survey respondents to indicate whether
they are a UK student or an international student. Students will be
asked to sign a consent form to indicate that they are happy for their
interview to be recorded and analysed, and for segments of the interview
to anonymously quoted in the write-up. The original recordings will be
deleted after transcription, and the transcriptions will be redacted to
remove identifiable, sensitive or irrelevant information before the
coding is performed.

## Project outcomes & impact

Earlier we emphasised the urgent need to move beyond general statements
and hypotheses about the likely impact of GenAI on learners, towards a
nuanced and granular understanding based on empirical evidence. The
conclusions of our study will therefore be of substantive interest in
and of themselves, which is why we intend to put them forward for wider
dissemination via a peer reviewed journal.

At the same time, our primary motivation for this research is the need
to update the suite of programming courses in the School of Physics and
Astronomy. Drawing on our depth of experience and insights gained from
our study, we will create a set of guidelines and recommendations aimed
at assisting Course Organisers (ourselves included). Due to the
magnitude and ongoing nature of these changes we anticipate the need for
an adaptive, multi-stage process of course redevelopment. We feel it is
important to ensure that the student voice is listened to from the very
start of this process.

The University of Edinburgh is a global leader in education research,
and the School of Physics and Astronomy stands among a very small number
of UK institutions with a dedicated research group in tertiary physics
education. This project will underline our reputation for high-quality,
timely research, and we fully expect there to be wider interest in the
results of our study among other universities.


## Sharing your project

### Publication of work

We will produce a research paper that will be submitted for publication
in the open-access peer-reviewed journal *Physical Review Physics
Education Research*, and specifically in the \'Focused Collection\' *AI
Tools in Physics Teaching and PER*. A pre-print version of this same
article will also be published immediately upon completion on the
open-access repository *arXiv* in the *physics.ed-ph* section. Our
article proposal has so far made it through the first review stage, but
if we are not accepted into this edition of PRPER we will seek to
publish in another peer-reviewed journal.

### Blog

JMR will chronicle the project via a series of blog posts hosted on
GitHub and freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The
blog format allows for more a more granular and reflective account of
the project, and it will be written with the intention of being
maximally useful to future studies. The blog will include (i) a review
of key literature, (ii) a methodological toolkit, and (iii) a narrative
account of being a researcher from a STEM discipline leading a project
based on the collection and subjective interpretation of qualitative
data. JMR will condense the highlights from the standalone blog into a
guest blog post for the *Teaching Matters* blog. This will include links
to the published material and standalone blog. A project homepage will
be created within the SoPA webpages to help direct people to the
published paper and the blog.

### Seminars & Presentations

We will hold an internal seminar with the key staff in SoPA to share and
discuss the findings from our study. This will occur during the Summer
break, giving sufficient time for Course Organisers to operationalise
our findings in time for the Autumn semester. On their request, JMR will
give a guest seminar in the newly-formed Computer Science Education
group in the School of Informatics.

We will also seek out further dissemination opportunities, e.g. in the
School of Education and the Edinburgh Futures Institute. Finally, JMR
intends to travel the next iteration of the National Conference on
Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education, which has been held at
Ulster University in January the last two years, to present the results
of our study to a wider audience. Alternatively, we anticipate many
suitable conferences in which our study can be disseminated throughout
the summer conference season of 2025.

## Updates & response to PTAS panel feedback

### Related PTAS Project

> *"Your proposal has some similarities to another PTAS project in
> Informatics led by Pavlos Andreadis. Please contact Pavlos to see if
> there are any productive crossovers between your two projects and also
> to ensure clear differentiation between your two projects. Describe to
> the PTAS committee, how each project will contribute uniquely."*

We are grateful to the PTAS panel for alerting us to Dr Andreadis' and
collaborators' project. This project also focuses on the integration of
GenAI into programming courses, though there are marked differences
between our projects in focus, methodology and scope. In light of these
differences we view our two projects as complementary rather than
equivalent.

Dr Andreadis' and collaborators' project aims to develop a 'living
document' serving as a source of reference and a methodological
'toolkit' for educators, covering a broad range of issues related to the
integration of GenAI into the teaching and learning of programming. They
will seek input from both teachers and students in the Schools of
Informatics, Mathematics and the Business School, through large-scale
surveys and focus groups.

We remark on some key ways in which our project differs from Dr
Andreadis'. Essentially, whereas Dr Andreadis' project aims to be
holistic and seeks input from as many sources as possible, ours is
narrowly focused on the detail and nuance of individual student
experiences. We expect students to voice perspectives that challenge
those of teachers, and thus the findings from interviews are intended to
be used as 'guardrails' and 'quality control' which will feed into but
not constitute guidance for Course Organisers. We argue that one-to-one
interviews can probe different aspects of the student experience than
surveys and focus groups, and therefore that our approaches are
complementary and can serve as cross-validation for each other. Another
important difference between the two projects is that we are
particularly interested in the cohort whose undergraduate studies
spanned the period in which GenAI became popularised, whereas the
student-oriented component of Dr Andreadis\' study appears to have a
more explicit feed-forward structure whereby students in earlier
year-groups are encouraged to come forward and influence their own
future learning experience.

After a discussion with Dr Andreadis, we have mutually agreed to
maintain regular communication over the duration of our projects. We
have furthermore provisionally agreed to the following collaborative
activities:

-   Our team may contribute a chapter to the 'toolkit' being created by
    Dr Andreadis and collaborators, based on the findings from our study
    and the guidelines we develop for the School of Physics & Astronomy.

-   We will regularly attend the seminar series being organised by Dr
    Andreadis and colleagues in the School of Informatics, and we have
    been kindly offered space to present both interim and final
    conclusive results from our study.

-   We will promote the toolkit in the School of Physics & Astronomy,
    especially among other Course Organisers of programming courses.

### Ethics Approval

> *"Please confirm that approval has been obtained or will be obtained
> before the research commences."*

We can confirm that we have obtained ethics approval for this project
from the School of Physics & Astronomy, in line with Universities UK
Concordat on Integrity, CSE and UKRI policies.

### Timeframe & Budget

> *"The committee felt that the current timeframe was too short for the
> scope of the proposed work, especially with an April 2024 start. We
> would like you to extend the timeframe for project and should consider
> adding 3-4 months to the current timeframe to enable all work to be
> completed."*

We agree that the original time-frame was optimistic. We propose that
the start date is postponed to June 1^st^ and the project duration is
extended by 3 months to cover the Autumn semester 2024. In addition to
allowing more time to do the research thoroughly, this has the advantage
that the bulk of the interviews may be conducted during the semester
where students are present on-campus.

JMR will not be able to continue as RA from September 1^st^. However, we
have found an excellent candidate to take over this role for the
remaining four months of the project. This individual, who will graduate
with a Bachelors degree this summer, is enthusiastic and highly capable;
by the time they take over they will have already completed two research
projects on the topic of GenAI and teaching -- their Bachelors thesis
and a summer research placement under the supervision of JMR. There will
be a seamless handover at the end of August, and JMR will remain
available to provide support and guidance throughout the remainder of
the project duration.

> *"Revisit and revise the budget. Add additional research assistant costs
> for extending the timeframe."*

We have added an additional three months of stipend for part-time RA
work, on top of the four months originally requested. We have adjusted
the pay grade in line with standard pay for PDRAs and PGRAs in SoPA.

> *"The budget details no costs for interview transcription. Please add
these if necessary. If not necessary, please indicate why this isn't
required."*

The RA will do the transcribing so these costs are contained within the
RA\'s stipend. Automated transcription software will be used to create a
first approximation of a transcript, which the RA will then check, edit
and format while listening to the audio recording. We feel that this
approach strikes a reasonable balance between time-efficiency and the
analytical benefits of the researcher doing the transcribing themselves.
We will only use transcription software for which we are completely
satisfied that the input data is secure, i.e. not used for any other
purposes and deleted once the transcription is finished.

> *"Add costs for dissemination, in particular conference attendance is
> mentioned in the application. Please add costs if this is required."*

We have listed several ways in which we will disseminate our research
both within and outside of the University. The majority of these do not
come with a cost. However, we would like to send a member of our team to
deliver a presentation at a dedicated conference for AI in Higher
Education in 2025. There are several such conferences held in Europe
each year (e.g. the National Conference on Generative Artificial
Intelligence in Education mentioned previously), but at this point dates
and conference fees for 2025 have not been publicised. Based on the fees
for this years\' conferences, we have requested £1000, which includes an
estimate of £500 for accommodation and travel. Should we end up
requiring less than £1000 we will happily return the remaining money to
PTAS.

Our proposed article has passed first review and is currently under
second review for the Physical Review Physics Education Research
journal. This is a \'Gold\' open-access journal and should our article
be accepted for publication the cost of publishing will be \$1430
(approximately £1126). Should our proposal be rejected we will submit it
to another peer-reviewed journal which will likely have similar
publishing costs.

### Responses to additional comments

> *"Would an element of anonymity be useful? Will students who have
> engaged with courses where AI was banned be honest about their views?"*

We agree! The student interviewees will be entirely anonymous from the
perspective of teaching staff at the University. Only the RAs, who will
not have further teaching duties beyond the end of this project, will
know their identity. As stated previously, we will ensure that
interviewees fully understand this, and the way in which their data will
be anonymised, prior to the interview.

The information gathered in interviews will not be used to 'check for
cheating' in courses that are in progress. There is little risk of this
since none of our team are involved in courses which impose a strict ban
on GenAI.

For the survey, we will also keep students anonymous. This means we can
ask them to fill in general information such as their year group and
preferred gender, but we will refrain from asking for information on
ethnicity or any other characteristics that might identify individuals
when corroborated.

> *"The relationship between the survey and the interviews is not clear --
> will the survey be informed by the interviews?"*

Our intention is for the survey to inform the interviews, rather than
vice versa. The interviews are really the main focus of this study, but
we hope that a survey on a larger scale may draw our attention to areas
where we lack granular understanding, and hence help us to design
interviews that probe these areas. Other than that we view the survey as
a means of cross-validation for the interviews, and as a second line of
defence against over-generalisation of our findings.

We originally meant to recruit all interviewees via this initial survey.
However, with the extended time-frame we can now recruit by speaking
directly to students in the Physics department during the first week of
the semester, which we expect to have a higher success rate. We still
aim to recruit a small number of students who are graduating this summer
from the initial survey.

> *"How will student interviewees be selected to ensure appropriate
> representation?"*

We have discussed this issue at length in the 'Methods and Evaluation'
section, although it is fair to observe that we have not detailed a
strategy for selection. We will select a cross-section of year groups
and genders -- that is the relatively easy part. If we were collecting a
larger sample, we would use some selection algorithm that pools
candidate interviewees into 'like' groups and randomly selects a
representative number from each group. However, since we are looking at
a small sample we feel it is preferable to rely on our judgement in
selecting interviewees, seeking a broad range of perspectives based on
responses to an initial question prompt when students sign up as
candidate interviewees.

### Budget justification

The project proposal is based on a model in which the time-consuming
bulk of the research is conducted initially by a PDRA (JMR) who has been
heavily involved with the development of this project, and later by a
PGRA after a period of working alongside JMR. The funds requested
include a stipend for part-time research at standard pay grades for
PDRAs and PGRAs in SoPA. We believe that offering incentives to
participate in surveys is worth the relatively low cost, since we are
more likely to have greater sign-up and hence ability to select a more
representative sample. We have budgeted for the cost of a single member
of our team attending and presenting our work at a conference, which is
a reasonable balance between keeping costs low while effectively drawing
attention to our work and the enhancing the University's reputation in a
highly topical area of research.

## Project team expertise

### Joe Marsh Rossney

I recently completed a PhD in SoPA where my research was on GenAI
applications in particle physics. I am an Associate Fellow of the
Advanced Higher Education Academy (now Advance HE) and am currently in
the final stages of the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice
(PgCAP) programme taught by the Institute for Academic Development here
in Edinburgh. I have been a teaching assistant on various courses in
SoPA since 2020, including two programming courses, and more recently I
have been working as a teaching assistant in the Edinburgh Futures
Institute on two courses themed around the ethics of data and AI. Before
coming to Edinburgh I was a teaching assistant at a secondary school
where my primary role was providing additional support for students with
special educational needs. My interest in technology in education is
longstanding, but I came up with the idea for this particular project
while taking the 'Researching Your Teaching' course as part of the
PgCAP. I do not have prior experience with qualitative research, other
than creating and analysing an end-of-course survey, but I am committed
to learning and improving 'on the job', which will include asking for
help where help is needed.

### Ross Galloway

I am a Senior Lecturer in SoPA and also the leader of the school's
Physics Education Research (PER) Group. I have over 20 years' experience
in the teaching of physics and astronomy at the HE level, and 15 years
of experience as a disciplinary-based pedagogical researcher. My
previous projects in PER have incorporated quantitative, qualitative and
mixed methods approaches, so I am well-versed in the methods to be used
in this project. As a former Director of Teaching within SoPA, I had
oversight of some of the challenges around the rapid influx of GenAI
into the undergraduate sphere, and also questions of how to coherently
respond at course, programme and school level.

### Britton Smith

I am a Reader in the Institute for Astronomy in SoPA at University of
Edinburgh. I am currently the Course Organizer for Computer Simulation,
an introductory Python course focusing on object-oriented programming to
model physical phenomena. This course has roughly 180 first- and
second-year undergraduate students. In the past year, I have witnessed a
major shift in the way students undertake programming exercises in this
course, away from peer interaction and toward consultation of GenAI. The
results of this study will have direct and considerable impact on this
course. I am very interested to understand how students perceive the
value of learning code development amidst the rise of GenAI and how I
can continue to make the course feel relevant to them.

## Equality impact statement

### Project Team

The diversity of our project team is limited by a combination of staff
availability and a more fundamental homogeneity of the people involved
in the delivery of our programming courses. It would be very beneficial
if the project team were as diverse as the students; we are mindful of
the risk of designing a study that reproduces the biases inevitably
present in our priors. In particular, with the interview format
knowledge is co-created by both the interviewer and interviewee, so
having multiple interviewers with different backgrounds and
personalities would be helpful. We note that we have had, and intend to
continue to have, discussions with interested colleagues and students
who are not listed on the project team. That is to say there are
established channels from which we can receive input from more diverse
perspectives.

### Participation and involvement

We do not expect there to be a barrier that disfavours under-represented
groups in terms of their willingness to volunteer as interviewees, other
than potentially a reluctance or scepticism about being interviewed (by
a white man), which may be felt unequally. In agreeing to be
interviewed, or even filling out a survey, the students are entrusting
the researchers with their 'data', some which may be personal and
sensitive. It is important that we are not just vigilant about the
privacy aspects of the study, but also transparent so that students feel
able to trust us. By holding some interviews over Microsoft Teams we do
unfortunately lose some nuances afforded by in-person interviews, but
some students will prefer this format. This is particularly true for the
initial interviews, which take place outside of term time; a journey
onto campus for a single interview may be very inconvenient for e.g.
students with disabilities or work commitments.

### Methods or Evaluation

It is highly plausible that the experiences and perspectives of students
towards programming and GenAI are differentiated along intersection
lines. Both physics and programming are fields that have historically
been dominated by white western men, and this historical and cultural
fact permeates into the experiences of current students to varying
degrees. As an example, it may emerge from our study that non-dominant
groups (e.g. women) report different social experiences in the computer
labs, which may lead them to appreciate GenAI as a 'non-judgemental'
assistant.

Having recognised this, it is important to stress that the methods
proposed in this study come with substantial risks of drawing
conclusions that are systematically biased in a way that potentially
harms certain under-represented groups. Any sample-based methods have
the potential to suffer from non-generalisability, and the researcher
has a duty to guard against over-extrapolating results from small or
unrepresentative samples. From a statistical perspective, in the former
case the theoretical statistical errors are large and in the latter case
results will be biased in a way that is generally impossible to
'correct' post-hoc.

We make no claim to guarantee a truly representative sample -- indeed it
is probably a fallacy to imagine that such a thing exists. It would be
ideal if students from a wide range of backgrounds put themselves
forward for interview, but cherry-picking individual students comes with
its own ethical issues. Even with an apparently representative sample,
it would be dangerous to take a very small number of people with a
particular characteristic, e.g. religion or ethnicity, as somehow
representative of all people sharing that characteristic. This comes
back to the fact that, in studies such as ours, one cannot abstain from
a subjective, holistic analysis by appealing to statistical arguments.
The main tool we have to protect the integrity of our study and the
well-being of students is our full engagement with the complexity and
intangibility of the questions we have posed.

As discussed in the 'Method' section, identifiable information from the
interviews and survey will not be included in the analysis. While our
intention is to include certain characteristics such as gender in the
analysis, we are committed to protecting the anonymity of interviewees
and will take necessary precautions.

### Sharing your findings

We have laid out a suite of dissemination strategies that include
textual reports and oral presentations. We are fully committed to open
accessibility of our project outputs, which will be available online
with zero further access requirements. We feel it is important to not
only publish the final results but also detail the process in a way that
can be used to critique or replicate the work in future, which motivates
the inclusion of a blog on top of a traditional scholarly article. We
will *not* publish full transcripts from the interviews, though some
suitably redacted snippets will be included within the main report.
