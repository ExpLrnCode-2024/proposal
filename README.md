# Proposal

This repository contains the project proposal submitted to the [Principle's Teaching Award Scheme](https://institute-academic-development.ed.ac.uk/funding/ptas) (PTAS) in March 2024, minus the budget breakdown.

This is a once-revised version, resubmitted after an initial review by the PTAS panel. The review comments and our responses are included in the document.

We are making this publish (a) for reasons of transparency, and (b) in case it is a useful reference for someone else thinking of applying for a PTAS grant.
submitting a project proposal to PTAS.

Although the project changed shape during the course of its lifetime, this still accurately describes our thought process and intentions.

The most convenient way to read the proposal is at the [GitHub Pages site](https://ExpLrnCode-2024.github.io) for the project.

We gratefully acknowledge that funding for this Principle's Teaching Award Scholarship (PTAS) project was provided by the University of Edinburgh Development Trust.
